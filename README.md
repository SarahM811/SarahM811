- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SarahM811
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a UX/UI developer. My UI work is not publicly available because projects I worked on are all internal to a financial institution.
- I have completed a bootcamp training in Java, but my strength is in UX work as well as in UI development. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning angular and react. 
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at sakim.eunjae@gmail.com
