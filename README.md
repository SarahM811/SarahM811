- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SarahM811
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a UX/UI developer. My UI work is not publicly available because projects I worked on are all internal to a financial institution.
- My work involves Javascript, HTML, CSS5, and jQuery. My team and I have created an internal library we use to build UI using plain javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS5.
- I have started learning reactJS and angular as well.
- Work you see in this repository is my work from early days before my career as a frontend developer started, mostly focusing on Java.
- Main goal and focus of my work is improving user experience.
- I have worked on all cycles of UI development including user research, user testing, mockups, and development of UI.
- I have completed a bootcamp training in Java, but my strength is in UX work as well as in UI development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning angular and react.
