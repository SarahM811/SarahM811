- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SarahM811
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a UX/UI developer. My UI work is not publicly available because projects I worked on are all internal to a financial institution.
- Main goal of my work is improving user experience.
- I have worked on all cycles of UI development including user research, user testing, mockups, and development of UI.
- I have completed a bootcamp training in Java, but my strength is in UX work as well as in UI development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning angular and react. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at sakim.eunjae@gmail.com
